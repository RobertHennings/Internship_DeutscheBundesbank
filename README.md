# Internship_DeutscheBundesbank
This repository contains small projects that I wrote during my time as an intern at the Deutsche Bundesbank in the Market Intelligence and Analysis 
Department. In consultation with my supervisor, these do not contain any confidential information or other clues or data that could indicate the final  use, so I was allowed to upload them here after consultation.

These are various small tools that use Excel as a GUI, but whose functionality is enabled by Python scripts.

Tools:
1) Supply Chain Dashboard data editing, formatting and staging for display in a Tableau file.
2) Heatmap of a correlation matrix with arbitrary variables.
3) Compound interest calculation for self-selected interest rates and years.
